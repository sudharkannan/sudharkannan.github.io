            <h1 id="section1">Summary</h1>
            <p>I worked in a pair with my partner in order to program a virtual car to drive through a simulated Gazebo track, 
                avoiding obstacles and reading signs on the way!</p>

        <h1 id="section2">Rules and Setup</h1>
        <p>We begin with the competition surface:</p> 
        <img src="assets/353/competitionsurface.png" alt="compsurface" class="rounded-image">
           
        <p>The competition consists of two main sections, the beginning "Road" section and the "Grass" section at the end. The sections both contain 
            various obstacles traveling on pre-set paths that the user must avoid colliding with. Furthermore, both sections also contain a number of signposts
             which each have one or two words on them.
            These signposts must be captured using computer vision techniques, read with a neural network, and the words must be submitted as a string to a clue 
            checker program in order to secure points. Points are awarded for clues reads, and deducted for any navigation errors.
        </p>


        <h1 id="section3">Technologies</h1>
        <h2>ROS</h2>
        <div id="sub">
            <p>ROS (Robot Operating System) is a tool that provides various libraries and features for developing robotics. ROS is comprised of a system of nodes,
                which are essentially modules or subprograms that each perform specfic functions, such as reading signboards, getting camera input, and so on.
                These nodes can communicate with each other thorugh a system called topics. A node can create and connect to a topic, and either publish or recieve
                to/from that topic. Other nodes can then connect to that same topic, and read or send information themselves.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the context of our competition,
                our code published our movement commands, timer starting instructions and various other data to different topics which were then read by Gazebo
                and the competition score tracking nodes, allowing us to move our robot and collect our points.

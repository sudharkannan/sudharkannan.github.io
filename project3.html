            <h1 id="section1">Summary</h1>
            <p>I created this portfolio from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Javascript! This project allowed me to explore the fundamentals of front-end 
                web design, while simulaneously allowing me to create a great platform to show my skills and interests!
                <div class = "images">
                    <img src="assets/Portfolio/home.png" alt="Home Page" class="rounded-image">
                </div>
            </p>
        </div>
        <h1 id="section2">Features</h1>
        <p>Beyond just creating a basic portfolio, I wanted to experiment with various features beyond simple text,
            as I wanted to getting a deeper undersatnd of how HTML and CSS interact, as well as gain appreciation for some of the cool things that can be done!
            Much of my learning in HTML and CSS came from Khan Academy and vaarious online resources, as well as ChatGPT to help understand some possible
            methods in implementing desired effects. I found that a lot of experimentation was required for certain effects, as 
            (at least in my free version experience) ChatGPT was not very reliable for more than a general overview of the code structure. This problem solving
            and debugging 
            ended up being a great way to learn! Furthermore, I chose to use pure HTML and CSS over any frameworks such as Astro or TailwindCSS, 
            as I really wanted a deep undersatnding of the fundamental code that is being run. 
        </p>
        <div id="sub">
            <h2 id="section3">Scroll Items</h2>
            <p>The first feature I wanted to implement was having items that appeared and vanished when the user scrolled, as
                I wanted to add interactivity and a sense of motion and smooth flow to my page. I accomplished this, as well as most things on this portfolio,
                 using JS and CSS! A JS script implements an EventListener that detects how far the user has scrolled from the top of the page, 
                 and once it hits a certain breakpoint, it changes the CSS opacity properties of the layer, which is also animated in CSS!
                  This lets the layer smoothly fade in and out, hiding and revealing the page underneath.
            </p>

            <h2 id="section4">Balls</h2>
            <p>I also wanted to add something that moved on my page, to make my page more dynamic and visually interesting.
                 I wanted this to be connected to my projects as wel, giving it an actual meaning beyond just something pretty.
                That is when I settled on the idea of having balls in the background, with each colour being connected to a project. 
                Not only does this look nice, it also serves as a visual representation of my work; the more projects I have, more balls and colours will appear!
                Making them clickable was an extra touch, adding more interactivity, and further showing how the balls are directly connected to my projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was done through another JS script, changing the circles position CSS properties randomly.
            </p>

            <h2 id="section5">Project Cards</h2>
            <p>On the projects page, I wanted to create cards to give a nice summary for my project, giving a brief overview for a user. Furthermore
                I wanted to show how each project was represented by a colour on the card, once again hammering home the connection between the balls and my projects.
                This was done through CSS properties, using effects such as ::after to format all elements on the card, as well as ::hover to create motion when the 
                user hovered over the card.
            </p>

            <h2 id="section6">TOC</h2>
            <p>Lastly, on the each project page, I wanted to implement a Table Of Contents in order to give the viewer an easy way to see all the content in the page,
                as well as allowing them to jump to specific pages. This was relatively easy! I learned about "anchors" in HTML, linking to a specific part of the page.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h1 id="section7">Goals</h1>
        <p>I am very pleased with the portfolio! However, there are still some things that I would like to improve. A lot of my code, 
            as you may expect from a project focused on learning, is unoptimal. I would to go back in and optimize it further!
        There are also some aspects of my code which are difficult to maintain; for example, adding a new project requires me to add a colour value at a number of 
        different points in my code. Streamlining this would be a very nice quality of life change, and make it easier to maintain.</p>

        <p>
            Overall, I am very pleased with what I've learned while working on this portfolio and I am committed to keeping this up-to-date in the future.
            Thank you so much for visiting!
        </p>

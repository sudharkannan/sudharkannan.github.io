        <p>While the circuit itself ended up being relatively straightforward to build, the process of building it and exploring each section of the circuit was an
            incredibly valuable experience, gibing me a lot of insight into circuit design, as well as the physcial processes of buiklding, testing, and debugging.
            The overall concept of the circuit is as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            A motor is attached to a disc with 10 slits at regular intervals. These slits provide a way for an LED to shine on a phototransistor, giving bursts of
            power at a frequency dependant of the speed of the motor and serving as our clock pulse (CLK). We also have a separate section of the cirtcuit that creates another
            pulse signl at regular intervals, which will be used to create periodic RESET and LATCH signals. Using the CLK and RESET signals on a counter ship, we can count
            the number of CLK pulses per reset pulse, which gets saved to a d-latch. The signals from this latch are fed to a 7-seg display, giving as a visual to understand
            how fast the motor is spinning, and also fed in to a DAC to give us our electrical speed measurement signal.
        </p>
        <p>
            This signal is compared with a reference signal that can be manually adjusted with a potentiometer, the output of which gives us our error signal.
            This signal is then applied to a transistor to control the current to the motor.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can go more into depth on each section:

            <h2 id="section3"> Latch+Reset</h2>
            <div class = "images">

            </div>
            <p>This section starts off with our "Measuring Period" Generator, which consists of a Schmitt-Trigger inverter
                in an RC circuit. 
            </p>
            <p>
                At a low input, the inverter returns a
high value, but at a high input, the inverter returns a low. Since the inverter originally has no input (capacitor
is uncharged), it will return a high. However, this circuit contains a feedback loop, so the high output is fed
back into the input, charging the capacitor, which now provides an input, and switching the output to a low until
the capacitor fully discharges. This cycle repeats, creating a steady period as the overall output with frequency
determined by the values of the resistor and capacitor. This output is then used for the rest of the circuit.
            </p>
            <div class = "images">
                <img src="assets/servo/sti circ.png" alt="Circuit" class="rounded-image">
            </div>
            <p>
                The blue is the output of the S=inverter, and the yellow is the input from feedback.
            </p>
            <p> 
                In order to ensure our wave is square and help reduce the impact of noise, we use a Schmitt-Trigger inverter with hysteresis,
                meaning the thresholds for flipping from high to low and low to high are different.
                These circuits are good at resisting noise and at squaring up waves with long rise and fall times. The noise
                reduction is due to the changing of the neccessary input voltage. If this wasn't there, you could imagine that the
                noise present at the turning voltage could cause the output to oscillate rapidly between a 0 and a 1. But with
                hysteresis, the voltage requirement is different enough that once the trigger flips, it requires an significant
                change in the input before it will flip again, resisting the small fluctuations caused by noise. The circuit is also
                good at squaring up waves with large rise and fall times, as the hysteresis helps remove any fluctuations that
                may happen due to the voltage being near the turning point for a longer length of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                This measuring period output is fed through another inverter to help reduce noise, and then serves as our LATCH pulse to continously update 
                our D-Latch
            </p>
            <p>
                The measuring period output is also run thorugh a small RC circuit, adding a short delay before being squared up again by another inverter as we want
                our counter to reset <em>after</em> the value has been stored in the latch.
                This output of this is then run through a high-pass filter with a very small time constant. This change our square wave to be very thin, giving a 
                very short pulse instead of long pulses. This is desirable as we want our RESET pulse to be registered once,
                 instead of having it be registered multiple times as the wave continues to give a high. This is then run through 2 inverters in order to square it up and ensure
                 it is in the same phase as before.

            <p>Blue is our RESET, yellow is our LATCH!</p>

            <h2 id="section4">Counter+Latch</h2>
            <div class = "images">
                <img src="assets/servo/dac.png" alt="Circuit" class="rounded-image">
            </div>
            <p>
                The counter works by having two 16 bit counters connected to each other, with their outputs wired into a seven
segment display. This allows the display to count from 0-255, in hexadecimal, with a total of 256 possible states.
Once this value is exceeded, the counter goes back to 0. This counter is clocked by the phototransitor pulse
from the motor, and reset by the pulse generator. This means that the counter will count the clocks pulses
emitted by the motor until it gets reset back to 0.
            </p>
            <p>
                The D-Latch will save the count of the counter whenever it recieves the latch signal from the pulse generator,
and the output of the latch will be displayed on the display. Since the counter is reset very slightly after the
d-latch is triggered, the d-latch will store the amount of clock pulses that happened during the last reset cycle,
which is proportional to the speed of the spinning motor.
            </p>
            <p>
                The value stored in the latch is converted to an analog voltage through the DAC, which is made up of a R2R ladder! This voltage is dependant
on the number that is displayed, and increases as the number increases, thus increasing as the speed of the motor increases and more CLK pulses are measured.
 This analog voltage is then passed
through an op-amp buffer, insulating the circuit from any affects of applied loads, then sent to the rest of the
circuit.

            </p>
            <div class = "images">
                <img src="assets/servo/phys circuit dac.png" alt="Circuit" class="rounded-image">
            </div>
            <h2 id="section5">Amp+Buffer</h2>
            <div class = "images">

            </div>
            <p>The Error Signal Amplifier serves as a comparator, testing whether the input speed measurement from the DAC
                is higher or lower than the setpoint provided. The setpoint consists of a simple voltage divider, and does not
                change over time (not counting manual tweaks), meaning the + terminal always has the same value. </p>
                <p>
                    When
                    the speed measurement goes into the - terminal, the Op Amp reads the voltage input. Op Amps will produce an
                    output to try and make both inputs equal, so if the speed measurement is lower than the set point, the Op
                    Amp will output a high voltage that feeds back into the input terminal, raising it, and supplying a larger voltage
                    to the rest of the circuit. On the other hand, if the speed measurement is higher than the set point, the Op Amp
                    will produce a negative voltage in order to lower the input, thus supplying a negative voltage to the rest of the
                    circuit. Since the speed measurement is the current speed of the motor, if the motor is spinning too fast the op
                    amp will produce a smaller voltage to slow it down, and if the motor is too slow the opamp will produce a higher
                    voltage to speed it up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Manually changing the potentiometer serves to change the setpoint voltage, increasing/decreasing the point the
input speed is compared to. This is how changing the pot allows you to change the motors speed.

                    The blue is our output, and the yellow is a test input wave from a function generator!

                    Next, the error signal is run through the protecting buffer. The protecting buffer serves as insulation for the rest of the circuit, restricting outputs to be between 5V and
                    0V. The two diodes connecting the the output of the error amplifier serve to restrict the possible voltage carried
                    forward. The diode that connects to the 5V rail allows current to drain out of the wire but not into it from the
                    power rail, meaning that current will drain out if the wire is higher than 5 volts. The other diode does something
                    very similar, allowing current to flow into the wire from ground, but not allowing power to drain out. This means
                    that if the voltage is negative, current will flow into the circuit, increasing the voltage to 0. Otherwise, the circuit
                    is not affected. Now that this signal is forced between 5V and 0V, it feeds into an opamp with feedback as a
                    buffer, ensuring that the circuit is not affected by the load of the motor.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The result is finally connected to a power transistor. The motor itself is connected to the 15V rail, with the other end connected to the BJT output. Therefore, the
                    lower the BJT output, the higher the voltage difference is, the more power the motor gets, and the faster the
                    motor willl spin. The diode on the motor ensures that any BJT output above 15V is drained away. This diode serves to protect
                    the circuit from any voltage spikes that may occur when the BJT is initially powered/turned off.
                    The BJT allows the current from the buffer to pass through, amplifying the small current from the circuit into the
                    large current needed to drive the motor.

            Overall, this project was a great way to combine the knowledge and techniques we've learned in our courses up to this point
into one project, as well as a good opportunity to get experience troubleshooting and working on something large
and complicated!
